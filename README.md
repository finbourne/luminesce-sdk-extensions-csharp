![LUSID by Finbourne](https://content.finbourne.com/LUSID_repo.png)

This is the C# SDK Extensions to accompany the [C# SDK (Preview) for the Luminesce application](https://github.com/finbourne/luminesce-sdk-csharp-preview). Luminesce is a SQL-based data virtualisation service (read/write data to multiple sources, including LUSID).

This extensions package provides the user with additional extensions to make it easy to configure and use the API endpoints.

Luminesce is part of the [LUSID by FINBOURNE](https://www.finbourne.com/lusid-technology) platform. To use it you'll need a LUSID account. [Sign up for free at lusid.com](https://www.lusid.com/app/signup).
